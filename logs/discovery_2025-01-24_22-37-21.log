Wrapped array:\n{\n    \"action\": \"modify_fields\",\n    \"body\": {\n        \"items\": [\n            {\n                \"field1\": \"value1\",\n                \"field2\": \"value2\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\n2. Direct array:\n{\n    \"action\": \"modify_fields\",\n    \"body\": {\n        \"data\": [\n            {\n                \"field1\": \"value1\",\n                \"field2\": \"value2\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Start with minimal required fields and add more gradually\n2. When you get an error about missing fields, add them to the body\n3. Use realistic test values for fields:\n   - strings: use descriptive values like \"test_value\", \"example@email.com\"\n   - numbers: use reasonable values (1, 100, 3.14)\n   - booleans: try both true and false\n   - arrays: start with 1 item, then try multiple\n   - objects: test nested fields thoroughly\n4. When a request succeeds:\n   - Try removing one field at a time to test if it's optional\n   - Try different value types to verify field types\n   - For arrays, test with different numbers of items\n5. Pay attention to error messages:\n   - They often indicate missing required fields\n   - They may hint at expected data types\n   - They might show format requirements\n\nIf you want to indicate we're done testing, respond with:\n{\n    \"action\": \"complete\",\n    \"body\": {},\n    \"explanation\": \"All fields have been discovered and tested\"\n}\n\nOnly mark as complete when:\n1. We've successfully made at least one request\n2. We've tested removing each field to determine if it's optional\n3. We've verified the types of all fields\n4. For array fields, we've tested both single and multiple items\n5. For object fields, we've tested all nested properties"},{"role":"user","content":"We are calling POST http://localhost:8081/api/users/complex. We start with an empty body.

{"model":"deepseek-chat","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are an AI agent that discovers required fields for an API endpoint.\nYour task is to help determine which fields are required and their types by analyzing API responses.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ALWAYS respond with a valid JSON object in the following format:\n{\n    \"action\": \"modify_fields\",\n    \"body\": {\n        \"field1\": \"value1\",\n        \"field2\": \"value2\"\n    },\n    \"explanation\": \"Why you're making these changes\"\n}\n\nFor endpoints that might accept arrays, try both formats:\n1. Wrapped array:\n{\n    \"action\": \"modify_fields\",\n    \"body\": {\n        \"items\": [\n            {\n                \"field1\": \"value1\",\n                \"field2\": \"value2\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\n2.

Start with minimal required fields and add more gradually\n2. When you get an error about missing fields, add them to the body\n3. Use realistic test values for fields:\n   - strings: use descriptive values like \"test_value\", \"example@email.com\"\n   - numbers: use reasonable values (1, 100, 3.14)\n   - booleans: try both true and false\n   - arrays: start with 1 item, then try multiple\n   - objects: test nested fields thoroughly\n4. When a request succeeds:\n   - Try removing one field at a time to test if it's optional\n   - Try different value types to verify field types\n   - For arrays, test with different numbers of items\n5. Pay attention to error messages:\n   - They often indicate missing required fields\n   - They may hint at expected data types\n   - They might show format requirements\n\nIf you want to indicate we're done testing, respond with:\n{\n    \"action\": \"complete\",\n    \"body\": {},\n    \"explanation\": \"All fields have been discovered and tested\"\n}\n\nOnly mark as complete when:\n1. We've successfully made at least one request\n2. We've tested removing each field to determine if it's optional\n3. We've verified the types of all fields\n4.

{"model":"deepseek-chat","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are an AI agent that discovers required fields for an API endpoint.\nYour task is to help determine which fields are required and their types by analyzing API responses.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ALWAYS respond with a valid JSON object in the following format:\n{\n    \"action\": \"modify_fields\",\n    \"body\": {\n        \"field1\": \"value1\",\n        \"field2\": \"value2\"\n    },\n    \"explanation\": \"Why you're making these changes\"\n}\n\nFor endpoints that might accept arrays, try both formats:\n1. Wrapped array:\n{\n    \"action\": \"modify_fields\",\n    \"body\": {\n        \"items\": [\n            {\n                \"field1\": \"value1\",\n                \"field2\": \"value2\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\n2.

Start with minimal required fields and add more gradually\n2. When you get an error about missing fields, add them to the body\n3. Use realistic test values for fields:\n   - strings: use descriptive values like \"test_value\", \"example@email.com\"\n   - numbers: use reasonable values (1, 100, 3.14)\n   - booleans: try both true and false\n   - arrays: start with 1 item, then try multiple\n   - objects: test nested fields thoroughly\n4. When a request succeeds:\n   - Try removing one field at a time to test if it's optional\n   - Try different value types to verify field types\n   - For arrays, test with different numbers of items\n5. Pay attention to error messages:\n   - They often indicate missing required fields\n   - They may hint at expected data types\n   - They might show format requirements\n\nIf you want to indicate we're done testing, respond with:\n{\n    \"action\": \"complete\",\n    \"body\": {},\n    \"explanation\": \"All fields have been discovered and tested\"\n}\n\nOnly mark as complete when:\n1. We've successfully made at least one request\n2. We've tested removing each field to determine if it's optional\n3. We've verified the types of all fields\n4.

{"model":"deepseek-chat","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are an AI agent that discovers required fields for an API endpoint.\nYour task is to help determine which fields are required and their types by analyzing API responses.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ALWAYS respond with a valid JSON object in the following format:\n{\n    \"action\": \"modify_fields\",\n    \"body\": {\n        \"field1\": \"value1\",\n        \"field2\": \"value2\"\n    },\n    \"explanation\": \"Why you're making these changes\"\n}\n\nFor endpoints that might accept arrays, try both formats:\n1. Wrapped array:\n{\n    \"action\": \"modify_fields\",\n    \"body\": {\n        \"items\": [\n            {\n                \"field1\": \"value1\",\n                \"field2\": \"value2\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\n2.

Start with minimal required fields and add more gradually\n2. When you get an error about missing fields, add them to the body\n3. Use realistic test values for fields:\n   - strings: use descriptive values like \"test_value\", \"example@email.com\"\n   - numbers: use reasonable values (1, 100, 3.14)\n   - booleans: try both true and false\n   - arrays: start with 1 item, then try multiple\n   - objects: test nested fields thoroughly\n4. When a request succeeds:\n   - Try removing one field at a time to test if it's optional\n   - Try different value types to verify field types\n   - For arrays, test with different numbers of items\n5. Pay attention to error messages:\n   - They often indicate missing required fields\n   - They may hint at expected data types\n   - They might show format requirements\n\nIf you want to indicate we're done testing, respond with:\n{\n    \"action\": \"complete\",\n    \"body\": {},\n    \"explanation\": \"All fields have been discovered and tested\"\n}\n\nOnly mark as complete when:\n1. We've successfully made at least one request\n2. We've tested removing each field to determine if it's optional\n3. We've verified the types of all fields\n4.

{"model":"deepseek-chat","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are an AI agent that discovers required fields for an API endpoint.\nYour task is to help determine which fields are required and their types by analyzing API responses.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ALWAYS respond with a valid JSON object in the following format:\n{\n    \"action\": \"modify_fields\",\n    \"body\": {\n        \"field1\": \"value1\",\n        \"field2\": \"value2\"\n    },\n    \"explanation\": \"Why you're making these changes\"\n}\n\nFor endpoints that might accept arrays, try both formats:\n1. Wrapped array:\n{\n    \"action\": \"modify_fields\",\n    \"body\": {\n        \"items\": [\n            {\n                \"field1\": \"value1\",\n                \"field2\": \"value2\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\n2.

Start with minimal required fields and add more gradually\n2. When you get an error about missing fields, add them to the body\n3. Use realistic test values for fields:\n   - strings: use descriptive values like \"test_value\", \"example@email.com\"\n   - numbers: use reasonable values (1, 100, 3.14)\n   - booleans: try both true and false\n   - arrays: start with 1 item, then try multiple\n   - objects: test nested fields thoroughly\n4. When a request succeeds:\n   - Try removing one field at a time to test if it's optional\n   - Try different value types to verify field types\n   - For arrays, test with different numbers of items\n5. Pay attention to error messages:\n   - They often indicate missing required fields\n   - They may hint at expected data types\n   - They might show format requirements\n\nIf you want to indicate we're done testing, respond with:\n{\n    \"action\": \"complete\",\n    \"body\": {},\n    \"explanation\": \"All fields have been discovered and tested\"\n}\n\nOnly mark as complete when:\n1. We've successfully made at least one request\n2. We've tested removing each field to determine if it's optional\n3. We've verified the types of all fields\n4.

{"model":"deepseek-chat","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are an AI agent that discovers required fields for an API endpoint.\nYour task is to help determine which fields are required and their types by analyzing API responses.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ALWAYS respond with a valid JSON object in the following format:\n{\n    \"action\": \"modify_fields\",\n    \"body\": {\n        \"field1\": \"value1\",\n        \"field2\": \"value2\"\n    },\n    \"explanation\": \"Why you're making these changes\"\n}\n\nFor endpoints that might accept arrays, try both formats:\n1. Wrapped array:\n{\n    \"action\": \"modify_fields\",\n    \"body\": {\n        \"items\": [\n            {\n                \"field1\": \"value1\",\n                \"field2\": \"value2\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\n2. Direct array:\n{\n    \"action\": \"modify_fields\",\n    \"body\": {\n        \"data\": [\n            {\n                \"field1\": \"value1\",\n                \"field2\": \"value2\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Start with minimal required fields and add more gradually\n2. When you get an error about missing fields, add them to the body\n3. Use realistic test values for fields:\n   - strings: use descriptive values like \"test_value\", \"example@email.com\"\n   - numbers: use reasonable values (1, 100, 3.14)\n   - booleans: try both true and false\n   - arrays: start with 1 item, then try multiple\n   - objects: test nested fields thoroughly\n4. When a request succeeds:\n   - Try removing one field at a time to test if it's optional\n   - Try different value types to verify field types\n   - For arrays, test with different numbers of items\n5. Pay attention to error messages:\n   - They often indicate missing required fields\n   - They may hint at expected data types\n   - They might show format requirements\n\nIf you want to indicate we're done testing, respond with:\n{\n    \"action\": \"complete\",\n    \"body\": {},\n    \"explanation\": \"All fields have been discovered and tested\"\n}\n\nOnly mark as complete when:\n1. We've successfully made at least one request\n2. We've tested removing each field to determine if it's optional\n3. We've verified the types of all fields\n4. For array fields, we've tested both single and multiple items\n5. For object fields, we've tested all nested properties"},{"role":"user","content":"We are calling POST http://localhost:8081/api/batch/users. We start with an empty body.
