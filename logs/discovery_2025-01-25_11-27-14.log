The user mentioned starting with an empty body, so the first step is to send a minimal request and see what error we get.\n\nIf I send an empty POST request, the server might return a 400 Bad Request error. The error message could indicate missing required fields. Common fields for a user endpoint are probably things like username, email, and password. But I need to confirm that.\n\nAssuming the first attempt with an empty body gives an error like \"Missing required fields: username, email, password,\" then those would be the required fields. But since the initial attempt is empty, maybe the server's error message will list which fields are missing. Alternatively, the error might be more generic, so we need to parse it carefully.\n\nSince we don't have the actual error yet, the first step is to send the empty request. But since the user is asking for the next steps, perhaps the AI agent should suggest modifying the request by adding the most probable fields based on common user creation APIs. For example, username, email, and password are often required. So the next step would be to try including those fields with valid values.\n\nThe values should be contextually appropriate. For example, the email should be a valid format, the username might have certain restrictions, and the password might need a minimum length. Using realistic test values helps in triggering the right validations.\n\nAlso, considering that this is a POST to /users, it's possible that the endpoint expects a JSON object with these fields. So the next action would be to modify the request body to include username, email, and password with valid values. If the server then responds with a success, we can note those fields as required. If there's still an error, we can analyze the new error message to adjust the fields accordingly.\n\nSo the proposed next step is to add username, email, and password fields with valid example values.

The user mentioned starting with an empty body, so the first step is probably to send a minimal request and see what error messages come back.\n\nSince the endpoint is /api/users/complex, it might expect more fields than a simple user creation endpoint. But to start, maybe the basic required fields are similar. Common fields for user endpoints often include things like name, email, password, username. But since it's \"complex,\" there might be additional fields or nested structures.\n\nFirst, I'll try sending an empty POST request. The response likely indicates missing required fields. Let's assume the error message mentions missing fields like 'firstName', 'lastName', 'email', and 'address'. Wait, but since I don't have the actual error yet, I need to hypothesize based on common patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the server returns a 400 Bad Request with an error message listing required fields. So starting with an empty body, the first error might tell us which fields are mandatory. But since the AI hasn't made the first request yet, the initial step is to propose the first modification to the body based on intelligent guessing.\n\nGiven the context of a user creation endpoint, especially a complex one, common required fields could be firstName, lastName, email, password. Maybe address is a nested object. So the initial fields to try might be these. Also, considering the endpoint's complexity, perhaps there are additional fields like phoneNumber, dateOfBirth, or other profile information.\n\nBut the key strategies say to start with minimal common fields. So maybe first try firstName, lastName, email, password. Use valid test values: \"John\" for firstName, \"Doe\" for lastName, a valid email like \"john.doe@example.com\", and a password that meets common criteria, like \"SecurePass123!\".\n\nWait, but maybe the password has specific requirements. If the error comes back mentioning password complexity, then adjust. But for the first attempt, using a reasonably strong password is a good start.\n\nSo the initial action would be to propose adding these four fields. The explanation is that these are common required fields for user registration, and using valid test values to match the field names.\n\nIf the server responds with an error about missing fields, then those can be added in subsequent steps. For example, if the error mentions 'username' is required, then add that. Or if there's a nested 'address' object with its own fields.\n\nAnother possibility is that the complex endpoint expects an array of users, but since it's a POST to /users/complex, maybe it's a single user with a complex structure. The action should start with a single user object, perhaps including nested fields.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'complex' part refers to having additional fields like preferences, roles, or other attributes. But without seeing errors, it's hard to know. So the initial approach is to propose common fields and build from there.\n\nSo the first step is to send a POST with firstName, lastName, email, and password. The JSON would look like:\n\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Doe\",\n  \"email\": \"john.doe@example.com\",\n  \"password\": \"SecurePass123!\"\n}\n\nThe explanation would be that these are common required fields for user creation, using valid formats to trigger any validation errors which can then inform further adjustments."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":508,"completion_tokens":812,"total_tokens":1320,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":448},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":711},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":448,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":60},"system_fingerprint":"fp_1c5d8833bc"}

'name' is typically required for identification, 'price' as numeric value is standard for products. Using realistic test values that match field name semantics (string for name, decimal for price).\"\n}","reasoning_content":"Okay, let's start by analyzing the problem. We need to discover the API schema for a POST request to the /api/products endpoint. The initial step is to send a minimal request and see what errors we get. Since the user mentioned starting with an empty body, the first response probably gave an error indicating missing required fields.\n\nLooking at the context of a products endpoint, common fields might include \"name\", \"price\", and \"description\". These are typical for a product model. The \"name\" is likely a required string, \"price\" would be a number, possibly a float or decimal, and \"description\" might be optional but a string as well. \n\nThe next step is to try these fields. Let's propose adding \"name\" and \"price\" first because they are often required. The values should be valid, like a realistic product name and a numeric price. Maybe using \"Test Product\" and 9.99. Then, if the response indicates a missing field, like \"description\", we can add that. Alternatively, the error might mention another required field we haven't considered yet. \n\nWe also need to consider data types. If the price is sent as a string, the API might return a type error, so using a number is better. But perhaps the API expects an integer for cents, like 999 instead of 9.99. However, since the example uses 9.99, that's a good starting point.\n\nAnother thing to think about is whether there are any other fields specific to this API. Maybe \"sku\" or \"category_id\" are required. But without prior knowledge, starting with the most common fields makes sense. The error messages from the initial requests will guide further adjustments. For example, if the first attempt with name and price still gets an error about a missing \"category\" field, then we'll add that next.\n\nAlso, considering that some fields might have validation beyond just presence, like minimum length for the name or a positive value for price. Testing edge cases could come later once the basic structure is confirmed. For now, focusing on the required fields based on the initial error is key.\n\nSo, the first modification should be to add \"name\" and \"price\" with valid values, then observe the response. If successful, check if more fields are needed or if there's a batch structure. But since it's a POST to /products, it's probably a single resource creation, not a batch. However, if the endpoint allows batch creation, maybe through an array, but the initial attempt is with a single object. If the first request with name and price works, then maybe \"description\" is optional. If not, adjust based on the error."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":506,"completion_tokens":643,"total_tokens":1149,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":448},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":550},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":448,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":58},"system_fingerprint":"fp_1c5d8833bc"}
