Since we're beginning with an empty body, the first step is to make an initial request to see what kind of response we get. Sending an empty POST request might trigger an error that gives us clues about required fields.\n\nI remember that user-related endpoints typically require basic information like name, email, or username. But without any prior information, the error message will be crucial. If the API returns a validation error mentioning missing fields, those are probably required. For example, if the error says \"email is required,\" then we know to include that field.\n\nAssuming the first attempt with an empty body results in an error, we need to parse that error. Let's hypothesize that the error might indicate missing fields like 'email' and 'name'. These are common in user registration endpoints. The next step would be to add those fields with valid values. For email, using a valid format like \"user@example.com\" is essential to pass format validations. For the name, a simple string like \"John Doe\" should work.\n\nAlso, considering security, maybe a 'password' field is required. But since the initial error might not mention it if the API expects it, perhaps including it in the next attempt would help. Alternatively, the error message might explicitly state which fields are missing. So, modifying the body to include email, name, and password with appropriate values would be the logical next step. Testing these fields will help determine which are required and what validations they have (like email format or password complexity).\n\nIf the next request with these fields succeeds, we might have identified the required fields. If not, the subsequent error messages can guide further adjustments. The key is to iteratively add fields based on errors and use semantically appropriate names and values to match the API's expectations."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":506,"completion_tokens":465,"total_tokens":971,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":448},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":374},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":448,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":58},"system_fingerprint":"fp_1c5d8833bc"}

Using valid formats to avoid basic validation failures while testing field acceptance.\"\n}","reasoning_content":"Okay, let's start by tackling this problem. The user is trying to discover the API schema for the POST endpoint at http://localhost:8081/api/users/complex. They mentioned starting with an empty body, so the first step is to make an initial request with minimal fields to see what happens.\n\nSince the endpoint is /api/users/complex, it's likely related to creating a user, possibly with more complex data than a simple user creation. But I shouldn't assume too much. The key strategies suggest starting with common fields. For user-related endpoints, typical fields might be email, username, password, or name. But since it's a \"complex\" endpoint, maybe there are more fields involved, but I should start simple.\n\nSo, the initial request with an empty body probably returned an error. Let me think about what the error might say. If the endpoint requires certain fields, the error message might list missing required fields. For example, if email and username are required, the error would mention those. But since we don't have the actual error yet, the next step is to propose adding some common fields.\n\nThe AI agent needs to suggest modifying the request body by adding some fields. The action should be \"modify_fields\" with a JSON body containing guessed fields. Let's pick email, username, and password because those are common in user creation. Also, maybe a name field with first and last names, as the endpoint is complex. Including age as an integer could help test type validation. Address might be a nested object, which would check if the API expects complex structures.\n\nThe explanation should mention that these are common user-related fields, and using valid formats (like email format for email) helps avoid basic validation errors. This approach tests both top-level fields and nested structures. If the API returns an error about missing fields, those can be addressed in subsequent steps. If it's successful, then maybe those fields are sufficient, but more testing might be needed to confirm all required fields.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't made any requests yet. The initial step is to propose the first modification. So starting with these fields makes sense. The goal is to trigger a response that gives more information, like missing required fields or validation errors. For example, if the address is required but not included, the error would indicate that. But since we're including address as a nested object, we can see if that's accepted or if more fields within address are needed.\n\nAlso, considering the endpoint is named \"complex\", maybe it expects nested objects or arrays. Including an address object with street, city, etc., helps test that. Age as an integer checks for type validation. The phoneNumber field could be a string but maybe needs a specific format. Using realistic test values like \"john.doe@example.com\" for email and a strong password like \"Password123!\" (though maybe the API has specific password requirements) is a good start.\n\nIncluding these fields allows the agent to see which ones are accepted, which are missing, and which might have validation issues. The next step after this request would be to analyze the response, whether it's a success or an error, and adjust accordingly. For example, if the response says \"email is required\" even though we included it, maybe there's a different field name expected, like \"emailAddress\" instead of \"email\". Or if the password needs a special character, the error would indicate that.\n\nSo, the proposed body includes a mix of common fields and a nested object to test the API's structure. This follows the strategies of starting with minimal but common fields, using semantic naming, and considering the API context (user creation with possible complex data). The explanation justifies each field choice and the approach to uncover required fields and structure through the response."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":508,"completion_tokens":948,"total_tokens":1456,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":448},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":768},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":448,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":60},"system_fingerprint":"fp_1c5d8833bc"}

Simplifying name to string format while keeping other fields unchanged to test if this correction allows successful processing and identify next potential validation issues.\"\n}","reasoning_content":"Okay, let's see. The user got an error when they tried the previous request. The error was \"json: cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field User.name of type string\". So, the problem is with the 'name' field. They sent a nested object for 'name', but the server expects a string instead.\n\nSo the first thing to do is correct the 'name' field. Instead of an object with 'first' and 'last', maybe it's just a single string. Let me adjust that. Then, since the error was about the 'name' field, maybe other fields are okay, but maybe there are other issues. Wait, the current fields include 'email', 'username', 'password', 'name', 'age', 'phoneNumber', and 'address'. The error only mentions 'name', so maybe the other fields are accepted, but maybe not all are required.\n\nThe next step should be to fix the 'name' field to be a string. Let's set it to \"John Doe\". Then, maybe check if the other fields are required. For example, perhaps some fields like 'age' or 'phoneNumber' are optional. To test required fields, maybe remove some optional ones to see if the request still goes through. But since the initial attempt had all those fields, and the error was only about 'name', perhaps the other fields are correct in structure but might not be required.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'address' field also needs adjustment. The user provided a partial address with 'street' and 'city', but maybe the server expects more fields like 'state' or 'postalCode'. But the error didn't mention that, so maybe it's okay for now. The priority is fixing the 'name' field first.\n\nAlso, looking at the error message, it's a Go unmarshalling error, which suggests the server is expecting a string for 'name' but got an object. So changing 'name' to a string should resolve that specific error. Then, after fixing that, the next errors (if any) can be addressed. So the next request should correct 'name' to a string and possibly simplify other fields to test for required fields.\n\nWait, but the user's previous request included a lot of fields. Maybe some of them are not required. But the error only occurred on 'name'. So first fix 'name', then see what the next error is. If the next error is about missing required fields, then we can add them. But maybe some fields like 'email', 'username', and 'password' are required. The address might be optional. But without knowing, the best approach is to correct the 'name' field and keep the other fields as they are, except 'name' as a string. Then, if there's another error about missing fields, we can adjust accordingly.\n\nSo the next step is to modify the 'name' field from an object to a string. Let's set it to \"John Doe\". Then keep the rest of the fields as before. That way, we can see if the 'name' correction allows the request to proceed or if other errors pop up. If there's a new error, like missing a required field, we can address it in the next step."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":737,"completion_tokens":745,"total_tokens":1482,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":448},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":666},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":448,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":289},"system_fingerprint":"fp_1c5d8833bc"}

Using valid formats to test basic validation and identify missing required fields.\"\n}","reasoning_content":"Okay, let's start by tackling this API endpoint for creating products. The user is making a POST request to /api/products with an empty body. Since we need to discover the schema, I should begin with the most basic fields that are commonly required for a product.\n\nFirst, considering the context of a products endpoint, typical fields might include \"name\", \"price\", and possibly \"description\". These are standard for product data. The \"name\" is almost always required, and \"price\" would likely need to be a numeric value. \"Description\" might be optional, but including it could help test if the API accepts additional fields.\n\nNext, I need to choose appropriate test values. For \"name\", a simple string like \"Test Product\" makes sense. \"price\" should be a number, maybe 9.99 to test decimal handling. \"description\" can be a brief string like \"Test description\". Using valid formats here helps avoid basic validation errors and gives clearer feedback.\n\nSince this is a POST request, the API might expect these fields in the body. Starting with these three fields allows us to check if they are sufficient for a successful request. If the API responds with an error about missing fields, we can then adjust accordingly. For example, if \"category\" is required, the error message might mention it, and we can add that in the next step.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any array or batch requirements, but since the endpoint is /products (plural), it's possible that it's designed for creating a single product. However, if the initial request fails, maybe the API expects an array of products. But starting with a single product object is more straightforward.\n\nIn terms of error analysis, if the response indicates missing required fields, we'll need to parse those field names from the error messages. For instance, if the error says \"price is required\", we know to include it. But starting with a minimal set helps narrow down the requirements.\n\nType detection is important here. Using a string for \"name\" and a number for \"price\" aligns with common practices. If the API expects a different format, like a string for price, the error should indicate that, allowing us to adjust the value type.\n\nSo, the first step is to send a POST request with \"name\", \"price\", and \"description\" using valid test values. This will help determine if these fields are sufficient or if more fields are needed based on the API's response."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":506,"completion_tokens":590,"total_tokens":1096,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":448},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":501},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":448,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":58},"system_fingerprint":"fp_1c5d8833bc"}

The user is trying to create a product via the POST /api/products endpoint. They started with an empty body and got an error that \"sku is required\". So the first thing they did was add some basic fields like name, price, and description, but probably didn't include the SKU yet. Now the next step.\n\nWait, in the previous step, the AI added name, price, and description, but the error mentioned that \"sku is required\". So maybe the initial attempt didn't include the SKU. So the user's next request would be after that modification. The error they received earlier was when they had an empty body. Then the AI added those three fields but not SKU. So the next request would probably result in the same error about SKU being required. Therefore, the AI should now add the SKU field based on the previous error.\n\nSo the current fields after the first modification are name, price, description. The next step is to include the SKU because the error said it's required. So the AI should propose adding the \"sku\" field with a valid value, like a test SKU. They might use a format that's typical for SKUs, such as alphanumeric, maybe uppercase letters and numbers. For example, \"TEST-SKU-123\". Then, they can check if that satisfies the requirement. Also, they might keep the other fields as they are to see if any other errors pop up after adding SKU. The explanation would be that the previous error indicated SKU is required, so adding it now. Also, ensuring it's in a valid format to avoid format-related errors. Additionally, they might check if other fields like name or price have any validation, but since the error was specifically about SKU, that's the priority."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":631,"completion_tokens":465,"total_tokens":1096,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":448},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":372},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":448,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":183},"system_fingerprint":"fp_1c5d8833bc"}

Progressive Discovery:\n   - Start with minimal, common fields\n   - Add fields based on error messages\n   - Use semantic naming to guess related fields\n   - Consider API context (e.g., /users endpoint likely needs email/username)\n\n2. Smart Value Selection:\n   - Use contextually appropriate test values\n   - Match values to field names (e.g., \"email\" â†’ valid email format)\n   - Consider common validation patterns\n   - Test edge cases when appropriate\n\n3. Array/Batch Handling:\n   - For batch endpoints, try both single and multiple items\n   - Test array wrapper keys: \"items\", \"data\", \"records\", etc.\n   - Ensure consistent field structure across array items\n\n4. Error Analysis:\n   - Extract field names from error messages\n   - Identify validation requirements\n   - Look for type hints in errors\n   - Parse both structured and unstructured errors\n\n5. Type Detection:\n   - Infer types from successful responses\n   - Consider field name conventions\n   - Test multiple value formats\n   - Look for format-specific patterns\n\n6. Field Requirements:\n   - Mark fields as required only when explicitly indicated\n   - Consider API context for likely requirements\n   - Test removal of fields to verify requirements\n   - Watch for dependent field relationships\n\nWhen you want to indicate completion:\n{\n    \"action\": \"complete\",\n    \"body\": {},\n    \"explanation\": \"Schema discovery is complete\"\n}\n\nComplete when:\n1.
